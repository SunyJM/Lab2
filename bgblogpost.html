  <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
  <p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> exicted about a new cooking technique
    called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge
    the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is
    preecisley set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked
    to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes it as
    "ultra-low-temperature poaching."</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon wil Dill
      Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
      before November 30.<p>

      if you are pregnant or have imminity issues.</h5>
